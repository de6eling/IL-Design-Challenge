<h1>Imagine Learning Design Challenge</h1>
<p>The project I had in mind is this: to create an HTML/CSS mock up of a teacher dashboard. If you could start from scratch, what data would you present to the teacher about their students and their performance? How do you anticipate the teacher would need to interact with this data?</p>


<h1>Getting Started</h1>
